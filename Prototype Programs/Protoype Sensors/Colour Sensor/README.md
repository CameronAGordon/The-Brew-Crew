This folder contains the code and data collected for the VEML6040 Colour Sensor in its entirety. It combines both the colour data of the liquid and the pH paper colour changes. 
Though pH isn't used in the final prototype, coke is shown to have a visible change in pH paper colour compared to the other beverages. 
If the process of collecting pH is more automatic, it can further differentiate the differences between beverages.
